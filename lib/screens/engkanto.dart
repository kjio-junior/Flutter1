        "The Tikbalang or Tigbolan is a tall, bony humanoid (half-human and half-horse) creature said to lurk in the mountains and rainforests of the Philippines. \n\n"
        "It scares travelers, leads them astray and plays tricks on them such as making them return to an arbitrary path no matter how far they go or turn.\n\n"
        "This is counteracted by wearing one's shirt inside out. \n\n"
        "Another countermeasure is to ask permission out loud to pass by or staying quiet while in the woods to avoid offending or  disturbing the tikbalang.\n\n"
        "It also assumes a variety of forms, and sometimes confers a similar gift upon a certain favored individual. \n\n"
        "A superstition popular with the Tagalogs of Rizal Province is that Tikbalangs are benevolent guardians of elemental kingdoms. They are usually found standing at the foot of large trees looking around for anyone who dares to bestow malignancy on their kingdom's territory. \n\n"
        "By one account a tikbalang has a mane of sharp spines, with the three thickest of these being of particular importance. A person who obtains one of these spines can use them as an anting-anting (talisman) to keep the tikbalang as his servant. The tikbalang must first be subdued, however, by leaping onto it and tying it with a specially-prepared cord. \n\n"
        "Or you can look on its mane and you will see 3 golden hairs and if you pluck 3 of them before he/she eats you, they will serve you until you die.",

        "It is customary to utter the phrase “Tabi tabi po” or “Excuse me” as a mark of respect  for the Nuno.\n\n"
        "Nuno sa Punso loves his solitude, and doesn't like it when people come  through, step on, or even get too close to his mound."
        "Even if trespassers just happen to come by accident, the Nuno will curse them regardless. A person cursed by the Nuno is called /nanuno/ or /namatanda/.\n\n"
        "Signs  of being cursed include a high fever, inconsolable pain, or swelling in  the offending body parts. \n\n"
        "To cure the curse, the person must visit an albularyo (folk healer) to be diagnosed via divination. Next, the victim and their family may be asked to provide an  offering (e.g., food, drinks, or valuable objects) to the Nuno in his  dwelling place."
        "In some situations, an animal sacrifice (often a white chicken) may also be used to soothe the Nuno's anger. If this  doesn't work, it is wise to personally ask the Nuno's forgiveness for  the misdeed.",

        "Some folk traditions claim that the Sirena carry their victims under the sea, sacrificing them to water deities. Other stories claim that the Sirena pretend to need rescuing from drowning, luring men into the sea, but proceed to squeeze the life out of any man who falls prey to their hoax.\n\n"
        "A malevolent Sirena may tease and attract human males with its spellbinding songs. Occasional reports had Sirena grabbing seemingly hypnotized humans and drowning them or taking them underwater. Another view had the tempted human chasing the Sirena into deep water until he drowned or that he had a heart attack upon seeing such an Engkanto and toppled into the water to his death.\n\n"
