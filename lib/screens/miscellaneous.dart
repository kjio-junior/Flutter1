        "St. Elmo's fire or Santelmo is a bright blue or violet glow, appearing like fire in some circumstances, from tall, sharply pointed structures such as lightning rods, masts, spires and chimneys, and on aircraft wings or nose cones.\n\n"
        "St. Elmo's fire can also appear on leaves and grass, and even at the tips of cattle horns. Often accompanying the glow is a distinct hissing or buzzing sound. It is sometimes confused with, or thought to be,  ball lightning.\n\n"
        "Stories of Santelmo (or Santilmo) say that it is the spirit of a man who has died near a river, lake, ocean, or during heavy rains. \n\n"
        "The lost soul appears as a ball of fire and some say  it seeks revenge on those who may have done him wrong, while others claim the soul is seeking peace.\n\n"
        "Scientifically, it is a weather phenomenon in which luminous plasma is created by a corona discharge from a rod-like object such as a mast, spire, chimney, or animal horn in an atmospheric electric field.\n\n"
        "St. Elmo's fire is named after St. Erasmus of Formia (also known as St. Elmo), the patron saint of sailors. \n\n"
        "The phenomenon, which can warn of an imminent lightning strike, was regarded by sailors with awe and sometimes considered to be a good omen.",

        "Mambabarangs are insect-wielding witches in Philippine mythology who use black magic to control insects and harm their victims.\n\n"
        "The Mambabarang is the Filipino version of a sorcerer; the witch is a Mamalarang. The the name is derived from the word barang. "
        "Other synonymous terms include the Hiligaynon word manog hiwit, which is also synonymous to kulam. The verb barangon or hiwitan means 'to place a hex'; a curse in Filipino is a sumpa. \n\n"
        "The Mambabarang is not like other mythical beings. It looks just like normal people but can do black magic. This makes them very unique in Philippine mythologies.\n\n"
        "The mambabarang keeps his beetles in a bottle or a section of bamboo, carefully feeding them ginger root. When the practitioner decides to employ his dark art, he performs a prayer ritual wherein he whispers instructions and identifies the victim to the beetles.\n\n"
        "The insects are then set free and to seek out the victim and gain entry into the body via any bodily orifice: the nose, mouth, ears, anus or dermal breaks such as open wounds. The victim will then feel the effects of the invasion through manifestations depending on the area of entry;"
        "hemorrhoids if through the anus, ear ache if through the ears and other similar cases.\n\n"
        "The resulting illness is resistant to conventional medical treatment and only reveals its true nature when the victim succumbs and flying insects issue forth from bodily cavities. Superstitious folks still attribute certain illnesses or diseases to barang.\n\n"
        "To safeguard against Mambabarangs, certain rituals and talismans are key. This protection can come from amulets crafted with natural elements like sacred plants, stones, or animal parts. Prayers, incense burning, and cleansing ceremonies help fortify this spiritual defense too.\n\n"
        "Local experts, including herbal doctors, albularyos or faith healers, mananambals or sorhuanas (female) / sorhuanos (male) and spiritual guides, know how to heal Mambabarang curses. They use plants, specific words, and rituals to free victims from the insects. This process aims to keep people safe and well.",

        "An albularyo is a 'folk doctor' commonly found in the more rural areas of the Philippines who heals people using herbs and traditional practices such as hilot or massage. \n\n"
        "The hilot ambiguously refers both to the manghihilot and magpapaanak. The manghihilot specializes in techniques and treatments applicable to sprains, fractures and muskuloskeletal conditions. The magpapaanak, besides prenatal visits and delivering babies, often performs the suob ritual.\n\n"
        "Pangalap is the process of searching for these medicinal plants and pabukal is the preparation of decoctions from said plants. \n\n"
        "They also use their own saliva and pieces of papers with writings. They may use Tawas (Alum) crystals to find out who is causing the ailments in their patients. Alternatively, they may also use Candle Wax poured in water, eggs, or spirits to divine the cause of the ailments\n\n"
        "Most of these healers consider their healing craft as God-given, a calling from a supernatural being, and consequently, their healing practices are profusely infused with prayers and religious rituals, performed through mediation with the Holy Spirit. \n\n"
        "Usually rural-based, they are also present in the urban and suburban communities, albeit in small scattered niches, serving burgis alternative needs, the impoverished or the urban-transplanted rural folk.",

        "Babaylan (also balian or katalonan, among many other names), are shamans of the various ethnic groups of the pre-colonial Philippine islands.\n\n"
        "These shamans specialized in communicating, appeasing, or harnessing the spirits of the dead and the spirits of nature.\n\n"
        "They were almost always women or feminized men (asog or bayok). They were believed to have spirit guides, by which they could contact and interact with the spirits and deities (anito or diwata) and the spirit world. \n\n"
        "The shaman's power to communicate with the spirit world is derived from their spirit companions that guide them and intercede for them. These spirits are usually referred to in euphemistic terms like abyan ('friend'), alagad or bantay (guardian'), or gabay ('guide'), among other terms.\n\n"
        "The friendship of abyan depend on reciprocity. The shamans do not command them. People with abyan must regularly offer sacrifices to these spirits, usually consisting of food, alcoholic drinks, ngang√†, and blood from a sacrificial animal (usually a chicken or a pig) in order to maintain good relations.\n\n"
        "The abyan are essential in shamanistic rituals as they prevent the shaman's soul from getting lost in the spirit world. They also communicate entreaties on behalf of the shaman to more powerful spirits or deities, as well as fight evil spirits during healing or exorcism rituals.\n\n"
        "The primary role of shamans were as spirit mediums. They were intermediaries between the physical world and the spirit world, due to their ability to influence and interact with the spirits (anito), both malevolent and benevolent.\n\n"
        "The Katalonas performed public ceremonies for community prosperity, fertility, or seasonable weather as well as private services to diagnose and cure ailments. They were respected for these functions but they were also feared sorcerers able to work black magic.",
