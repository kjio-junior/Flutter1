    name: "Bakunawa",
    description:
        "The Bakunawa or the moon-eating dragon, is a serpent, that looks like a Dragon in Philippine mythology. It is believed to be the cause of eclipses, earthquakes, rains, and wind.\n\n"
        "During ancient times, Pre-colonial Cebuanos believed that their supreme god, Bathala (could also be Kaptan, the  Visayan counterpart of Bathala), created 7 moons to light up the sky.  \n\n"
        "The Bakunawa, amazed by their beauty, would rise from the ocean and swallow the moons whole, angering Bathala and causing them to be mortal enemies.\n\n"
        "To keep the moons from completely being swallowed by the Bakunawa, ancient Filipinos would go out of their homes with pans and pots, and would bang on them with great force to make noise in order to scare the Bakunawa into spitting out the moon back into the sky.\n\n"
        "Other tales tell that the Bakunawa has a sister in the form of a sea turtle.The sea turtle would visit a certain island in the Philippines in order to lay its eggs. However, locals soon discovered that every time the sea turtle went to shore, the water seemed to follow her, thus reducing the island's size. Worried that their island would eventually disappear, the locals killed the sea turtle.\n\n"
        "When the Bakunawa found out about this, it arose from the sea and ate the moon. The people were afraid, so they prayed to the supreme god to punish the creature. The god refused but instead told them to bang some pots and pans in order to disturb the serpent.\n\n"
        "Others tell how the Bakunawa fell in love with a human girl in one of the native tribes. The head of the tribe found out about their affair and had their house burned to ashes.\n\n"
        "The Bakunawa, angered by this, tried to take revenge by eating all seven moons. When it was about to eat the last one, Bathala took action and punished the Bakunawa by banishing it from its home away from the sea."
        "It also says that the reason for the eclipses is how the Bakunawa is trying to come back to its home and deceased family.",

    description:
        "Haliya in Bicol mythology is  a lunar goddess and the arch-enemy of the dragon Bakunawa.\n\n"
        "Some sources say that she was a warrior goddess and wears a golden mask to hide her beauty.\n\n"
        "Some refute this, saying that there is no reason for her to hide her beauty.\n\n"
        "She is  depicted as a very lovely young woman with very fair and radiant skin,  and having long black hair and eyes as dark as midnight. She and Bulan (her brother)  are the most pursued and fairest beings in the heavens.\n\n"
        "Some say there were 7 moons that used to light up our skies, and Haliya is one of the seven embodiments of the moon along with her siblings who reside above the clouds beyond this world.\n\n"
        "Bakunawa, enthralled by their beauty, saught to possess them. Night after night for six nights he took another moon from the sky, and each time it melted away inside him. Haliya, the last of the 7 moons, valiantly fights every time Bakunawa tries to eat her. Through the mortal eyes, this is a lunar eclipse.\n\n"
        "In other sources, halia or halya was a ritual that was performed during a full moon to dissuade Bakunawa from swallowing it.\n\n"
        "THE ANCIENT NATIVES OF BICOL by Fray Jose Castaño - 1895  it is mentioned “One of the fiestas that celebrated with more apparatus and agaraba, the dreadful noise of drums, atables and balalongs or recessed logs, was dedicated to the moon in full, a party that they called Halia.”",

  GodsGoddesses(
    name: "Bathala",
    description:
        "In ancient Tagalog mythology, Bathala is regarded as the supreme being and creator of the universe, often referred to as Bathala Maykapal (Bathala the Creator). He ruled over all other gods and spirits and was believed to have created the world and everything in it, including the heavens, earth, and humans.\n\n"
        "Bathala lived in the sky and was sometimes associated with the sky itself, making him a sky god with immense power and authority over all natural and supernatural forces. Bathala was central to early Tagalog religion and was often invoked in rituals and prayers. \n\n"
        "Bathala is considered to be very humanlike in his appearance as he created human beings in his own image in the various creation stories that exist. Various stories of Bathala across the Philippines describe him as an ageless god with a flowing white beard but extremely strong and powerful.\n\n"
        "Bathala was all powerful and commanded obedience and reverence wherever he went. From his sky-like abode, Kawalhatian, Bathala can oversee humanity. \n\n"
        "He is pleased to see his people follow his rules and intentions. He is pleased when people do good to him, and he lavishes his love on those who paid him homage  by following his moral laws.\n\n"
        "His role mirrors that of a benevolent father figure who maintains cosmic order. With the arrival of Spanish colonizers and Christianity, Bathala was often equated with the Christian God, leading to the syncretism of indigenous and Catholic beliefs.\n\n"
        "Despite colonization, Bathala's name and legacy persist in Filipino culture, language, and folklore as a powerful symbol of divine creation and ancestral spirituality.",

    name: "Amanikable",
    description:
        "In pre-colonial Tagalog beliefs, Amanikable was the god of the sea, feared and respected by early Filipinos, especially by those living near coastal areas.\n\n"
        "He was represented as a long-haired and bearded tall man and often depicted as a rough and vengeful deity who would unleash storms or violent waves when angered.\n\n"
        "Fishermen and seafarers would offer prayers or rituals to appease him before setting sail, hoping for safe passage and abundant catches. \n\n"
        "His domain was vast and mysterious, representing both the bountiful and destructive powers of the ocean. Legend says Amanikable became bitter and wrathful after being rejected by a mortal woman, which may explain his often angry disposition in myths. \n\n"
        "While not as widely worshiped as Bathala, Amanikable played a vital role in Tagalog cosmology, representing nature's unpredictable and untamed forces.\n\n"
        "His legacy reflects the deep respect and fear early Filipinos had for the sea, which was central to their livelihood and survival.",
